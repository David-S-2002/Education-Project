# Using Data to Determine Whether ACT/SAT Scores in the U.S. are Predicted by Socioeconomic Factors

## Project Purpose
This project aims to use the data science methodology to answer a question about education inequality in the U.S.. Specifically, we will determine whether there is a relationship between average ACT/SAT scores and socioeconomic factors. We are using the EdGap dataset, which contains the average ACT/SAT scores from schools and socioeconomic information about school districts. We are also using a school information dataset from the National Center for Education Statistics. 

## Data
The EdGap data was obtained from [EdGap.org](https://www.edgap.org/#4/37.68/-95.98). The socioeconomic data is from the Census Bureauâ€™s American Community Survey. EdGap.org states that the test score data is from the states' departments of education or another public data release. The EdGap data is in the EdGap_data.xlsx. 

The school information data was obtained from the [National Center for Education Statistics](https://nces.ed.gov/ccd/pubschuniv.asp). The file name of the school information data is ccd_sch_029_1617_w_1a_11212017.csv. However, the file is too large for GitHub, so it can be accessed [here](https://drive.usercontent.google.com/u/0/uc?id=1HvW2w-o2XZzCm4KTvnb1Bb3BvoAa14BP&export=download).
