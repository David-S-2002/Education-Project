# Using Data to Determine Whether ACT/SAT Scores in the U.S. are Predicted by Socioeconomic Factors

## Project Purpose
This project aims to use the data science methodology to answer a question about education inequality in the U.S.. Specifically, we will determine whether there is a relationship between average ACT/SAT scores and socioeconomic factors. We are using the EdGap dataset, which contains the average ACT/SAT scores from schools and socioeconomic information about school districts. We are also using a school information dataset from the National Center for Education Statistics. 

## Data
The EdGap data was obtained from [EdGap.org](https://www.edgap.org/#4/37.68/-95.98). The socioeconomic data is from the Census Bureauâ€™s American Community Survey. EdGap.org states that the test score data is from the states' departments of education or another public data release. The EdGap data is in the EdGap_data.xlsx. 

The school information data was obtained from the [National Center for Education Statistics](https://nces.ed.gov/ccd/pubschuniv.asp). The file name of the school information data is ccd_sch_029_1617_w_1a_11212017.csv. However, the file is too large for GitHub, so it can be accessed [here](https://drive.usercontent.google.com/u/0/uc?id=1HvW2w-o2XZzCm4KTvnb1Bb3BvoAa14BP&export=download).

## Data Preparation
I took the following steps to prepare the data:
- Exploring the contents of the datasets
- Converting the data types of columns when necessary
- Selecting only some columns in the school information dataset
- Renaming the columns to be understandable, concise, and snake case
- Performing exploratory data analysis to see if the data are suitable for answering the question
- Joining the EdGap and school information data frames on the ID column
- Checking for rows with out-of-range values (like negative percentages or negative ACT scores) and dropping those rows
- Identifying missing values
- Dropping rows with missing categorical data
- Using Sci-kit Learn's IterativeImputer to impute the missing numerical data
- Creating a derived variable for the percentage of people who are employed
- Splitting the data into training and testing sets
- Exporting the training and testing sets

The file that performs the data preparation is David_Stanko_data_preparation_education.ipynb. The clean data files are train_data.csv and test_data.csv.
